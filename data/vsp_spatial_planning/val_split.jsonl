{"text_input": "\nAs a professional maze solver, your task is to analyze a grid-based map and devise an action plan that enables a player to reach the goal from the starting point without falling into any holes, using the fewest possible moves.\n\n## Game Setup\n- The game presents a fully observable grid-based map.\n- The player starts at a specified grid square, with the goal located elsewhere on the map.\n- Each grid square is either safe or contains a hole.\n- Your goal is to guide the player to the goal while avoiding holes.\n- For example, your final answer should be like \"L,L,R,U,D\", which means an action plan of left, left, right, up, and down.\n\n## Moving Rules\n- The action plan involves a series of moves: 'L' (left), 'R' (right), 'U' (up), or 'D' (down).\n- Each move transfers the player to the adjacent square in that direction, provided it is a safe square. The player cannot move more than one square at a time.\n- Moving off the edge of the map has no effect. The player will remain at the same square.\n- DO NOT MOVE INTO A HOLE! Falling into a hole results in defeat.\n- Locating at the grid containing the goal results in victory.\n\nHere is the map: <image>\n\nPlease provide your action plan.\n The final answer MUST BE put in \\boxed{}.", "image_input": "./data/vsp_spatial_planning/img/level_3/604/map_3x3_step_0.png", "image_output": "./data/vsp_spatial_planning/img/level_3/604/map_reasoning_path.png", "text_output": "\\boxed{UP, RIGHT}", "map_id": 604, "map_desc": [[0, 0, 2], [-1, 1, 0], [0, 0, -1]]}
