Then, the player can move down to reach the goal.\n\nThe action plan is:\n\\boxed{R,D}"}

{"index": 999, "prediction_raw": "To solve this maze, we need to guide the player from their starting position to the goal while avoiding the holes. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: The player is currently at the bottom-right corner of the grid.\n2. **Goal Position**: The goal is located at the top-left corner of the grid.\n3. **Avoiding Holes**: There are holes in the middle-left and middle-right squares, so we must avoid these.\n\nThe optimal path would be:\n- Move up to avoid the hole in the middle-left.\n- Move left to reach the goal.\n\nSo, the action plan is: \"U,L\".\n\n\\boxed{U,L}"}
